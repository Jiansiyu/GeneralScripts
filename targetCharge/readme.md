# Target accumulate Charge Calculate script
Given the Counting runID, search for the target Type(from runLog.csv) and the start time(from haplog) of the given production run. From the RCDB, 
search all the parity runs that taken before the counting run with the same targe type. Get all the accumulated charge for those parity runs.  

The halog need log in if run outside of JLab cumpus. And RCDB need to download the datafile if outside of the JLab computer. To avoid issues, it is strongly suggest run it on the JLab ifarm or aonl machine.

Adapt from Sanghwa's script.
